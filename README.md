# Friday Night Funkin' - vs Flavio

The vs Flavio mod was made for the **Friday Night Funkin' Mod Jam 2021**. It was promptly rejected because it wouldn't boot on the judge's computer.

It has now been rebuilt to utilize the full capabilities of the [Enigma Engine](https://github.com/EnigmaEngine/EnigmaEngine).

## Wait, where's the rest of it? Isn't there supposed to be an EXE?

Distribution of a full EXE is optional with Enigma Engine. You can instead simply place the mod data files into the `mods` folder, and Enigma Engine will display a mod loader to allow you to configure it.
